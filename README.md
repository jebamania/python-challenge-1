## Overview
At a high level, this program is doing the following
1. initialize a variable for a menu with categories, sub-categories, and items for sale with their price
2. starts a question loop to determine which category the user would like to order from
3. prints out the items for sale and sub-category for the user to select
4. adds the selection, followed by the quantity to the order
5. asks if the user is done order or has more to add
6. prints out the full order with line by line pricing and a total

## Customizations
1. from the given code, I did customize the variables for the menu to separate out the index/key from the name/category into their own attributes
2. I also customized the "receipt" by giving line by line totals (quantity x cost) and then a final total as expected.
